# Summary

UD Kʼicheʼ-IU is a treebank consisting of sentences from a variety of text domains but principally dictionary example
sentences and linguistic examples. 

# Introduction

The treebank was pre-annotated for morphology using the [`apertium-quc`](https://github.com/apertium/apertium-quc/) (Richardson and Tyers, 2021).
The morphological analyses were disambiguated and annotated for dependency structure by hand.
